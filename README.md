How to use P2P Files Server and Client
=======================================

These are the general instructions to do all the needed to use
a p2p files server service up and running.


Client use
------------

This is to be repeated in all places that you want the system to run.
It's assuming you're starting from a clean machine (e.g.: a just installed one,
or an LXC), if you're not you may have some of the needed parts
already installed.

Start the client

    ./client.py urls.txt files_share http://localhost:4243

Enjoy.
